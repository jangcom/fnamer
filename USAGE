NAME
    fnamer - Rename multiple filenames according to your conventions

SYNOPSIS
        perl fnamer.pl [-dirs=dname ...] [-pairs=old-new ...] [-space_to=-|_]
                       [-turn_off=routine ...] [-nofm] [-nopause]

DESCRIPTION
        fnamer helps renaming multiple filenames according to user specifications.
        The user can:
        - turn off the predefined rules
        - specify old-new string pairs on the fly
        - hardcode new rules**
        ** Define a new routine and register its information to
           the run_fname_modifiers routine.

OPTIONS
        Multiple values are separated by the comma (,).

        -dirs=dname ... (default: current working directory)
            Directories whose files and subdirectories will be renamed.
            If 'all' is input and a subdirectory named 'all' does not exist in
            the current working directory, all the subdirectories will be examined.

        -pairs=old-new ...
            Pairs of the old and new strings of filenames. Use this option
            for specifying your conventions on the fly.
            For instance, the options -pairs=rpt-deck,figures-figs,Phase-phase
            will rename rpt to deck, figures to figs, and Phase to phase.
            If given, these pairs will take precedence over the predefined rules.

        -space_to=-|_ (short form: -space, default: _)
            Whitespace replacement.

        -turn_off=routine ... (short form: -off)
            You can turn off the predefined routines listed below.
                custom_strings
                replace_whitespace
                remove_symbols
                yy_to_yyyy
                uncap_ext
                uncap_allcapped_substr
                unix_case

        -nofm
            Do not show the front matter at the beginning of the program.

        -nopause
            Do not pause the shell at the end of the program.

EXAMPLES
        perl fnamer.pl -dirs=.,../wow -pairs=fig-figs -nopause
        perl fnamer.pl -turn_off=yy_to_yyyy,custom_strings
        perl fnamer.pl -dirs=all -nopause

REQUIREMENTS
    Perl 5

CAVEATS
        - USE WITH CARE: renaming via this program is irreversible.
        - DO NOT work on filenames containing non-English letters; otherwise
          the filenames will be ruined FOREVER.
        - Multiple runs of this program with the same on-the-fly string pairs can
          lead to duplicate renaming. For instance, if you have a file called
          'fig.eps' and run the program with the option -pairs=fig-figs
          more than twice, the filename will eventually become 'figss.eps.'.
